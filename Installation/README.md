# Installing Docker

Docker is made out of Linux environment. It is the most easiest platform to install and run docker. Any Linux machine, be it you local system or on Cloud infrastructure, be it the Desktop version or the Sever-only flavour, if there is Linux Docker is absorbed pretty fast.

### To get started with Docker can be installed on a system via two ways : 
* from Docker Hub
* using Docker script

### Docker from Hub
 
The Docker hub contains the installation instructions for all major platforms. From Debian, to Fedora all the way to Azure and AWS Hostings. Just look for your platform and initially you'll get a detailed report of your platform followed by a link to docs with actual commands to install docker.

For Ubuntu(18.04) the commands are given in the [ubuntu folder](./Ubuntu)

### Docker from script
The docker community has already simplified the installation process. Docker provides a pre-written script which automates your docker installation with latest and most stable version of Docker. You can find the script [here](./Ubuntu/script.sh) or on the [web](https://get.docker.com).
